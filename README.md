# Azure Functions - Best Practices [Video]
This is the code repository for [Azure Functions - Best Practices [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/virtualization-and-cloud/azure-functions-best-practices-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788831499), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
Microsoft provides a solution to easily run small segments of code in the Cloud with Azure Functions. Azure Functions provides solutions for processing data, integrating systems, and building simple APIs and microservices. The course starts with intermediate-level videos on cloud application development along with tTesting Azure Functions on a staged environment and load- testing Azure Functions using VSTS. Then, you'll delve into the core aspects of Azure Functions such as the services it provides, how you can develop and write Azure functions. Moving on, practical videos demonstrate how to implement best practices by handling massive ingress for IoT and similar scenarios. By the end of this video, you will have all the skills required to work with serverless code architectures and provide continuous delivery to your users.
